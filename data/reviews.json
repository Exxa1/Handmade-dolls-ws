The colors in her dress and sweater right down to the buttons and hair bows are all so beautifully matched creating a very warm, cozy, textured, natural and playful look to this doll. Her sweet face and little rosy nose and cheeks truly tell a story creating a very cute personality for the doll. The artist who created the doll obviously poured forth so much love and positive energy into creating a very loved friend for the child it was gifted to Thank you : )",
