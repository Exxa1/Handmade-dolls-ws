    This wonderful felt wall hanging is admired by all our visitors and we absolutely love it. It arrived less than a week after we bought it and was in perfect condition. We can highly recommend this fabulous artist!

    I got this doll for my son and I couldn't be happier. When I unwrapped him, I immediately felt the quality that went into this doll. Other reviewers are right, these dolls are even better in person.

    We are collectors of Waldorf dolls, this one is truly unique as the body is entirely hand knit creating a lovely warm look and feel to the doll. The colors in her dress and sweater right down to the buttons and hair bows are all so beautifully matched creating a very warm, cozy, textured, natural and playful look to this doll. Her sweet face and little rosy nose and cheeks truly tell a story creating a very cute personality for the doll. The artist who created the doll obviously poured forth so much love and positive energy into creating a very loved friend for the child it was gifted to! Thank you : )
